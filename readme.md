# MQTTHandler Library

## Overview

The MQTTHandler library is a lightweight, static TypeScript-based MQTT broker utility designed to simplify the use of the MQTT protocol for IoT and real-time messaging. the library uses a static approach to remove the need for repeated instantiation, ensures a single connection across your application, and provides robust event-driven communication via EventEmitter.

## Features

- Static Design: Simplifies usage by managing a single shared MQTT client instance.

- Event-Driven: Uses EventEmitter to handle message events seamlessly.

- Ease of Use: Intuitive APIs for connecting, publishing, and subscribing to MQTT topics.

- Error Handling: Provides detailed error messages for debugging.

- Scalable: Designed for lightweight, efficient message handling

## Installation

Install the library from npm:

```bash
npm i vmind_mqtt
```

## Usage

Import the Library

```typescript
import { MQTTHandler } from "vmind_mqtt/dist";
```

##Â Initialize the MQTT Client

Before using the library, initialize the MQTT client with the broker URL:

```typescript
MQTTHandler.initialize("mqtt://broker.hivemq.com");
```

## Publish a Message

Send a message to a specific topic:

```typescript
MQTTHandler.publish("test/topic", JSON.stringify({ message: "hello, MQTT!" }));
```

## Subscribe and Listen to a Topic

Listen for messages from a subscribed topic:

```typescript
MQTTHandler.listen("test/topic");

MQTTHandler.onMessage((data) => {
  console.log(`Received message from ${data.topic}:`, data.message);
});
```

## Close the MQTT Connection

Gracefully close the MQTT connection when done:

```typescript
MQTTHandler.close();
```

## Example

```typescript
import { MQTTHandler } from "your-mqtt-library";

// Initialize the client
MQTTHandler.initialize("mqtt://broker.hivemq.com");

// Subscribe and listen to a topic
MQTTHandler.listen("example/topic");
MQTTHandler.onMessage((data) => {
  console.log(`Received message on topic ${data.topic}:`, data.message);
});

// Publish a message
MQTTHandler.publish(
  "example/topic",
  JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello, World!" })
);

// Close the client after some time
setTimeout(() => {
  MQTTHandler.close();
}, 5000);
```

## Advantages of the Static Approach

1. Singleton Pattern:

   - Ensures a single MQTT connection instance across your application, reducing overhead and connection management issues.

2. Simplified API:

   - No need to instantiate the client repeatedly; directly use static methods to interact with the broker.

3. Event-Driven Communication:

   - Uses EventEmitter to handle messages, enabling clean, modular, and decoupled code.

4. Lightweight:

   - Avoids dependencies on frameworks like Express, making it ideal for small services or microservices.

5. Flexibility:
   - Easily integrates into any TypeScript or Node.js project.
